##  Common Problematique

A recurring issue across all 11 research papers is the **integration and implementation of Digital Twin (DT) technologies within Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**. The main challenges discussed include:

- Real-time data synchronization between physical systems and their digital counterparts.
- Ensuring interoperability among heterogeneous systems and platforms.
- Maintaining data security and privacy in interconnected environments.
- Scalability and flexibility of DT models to adapt to evolving system requirements.

These shared concerns highlight the need for robust, secure, and scalable frameworks to effectively deploy Digital Twins in CPS contexts.
