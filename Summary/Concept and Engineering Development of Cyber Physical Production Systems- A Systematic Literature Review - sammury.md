**"Concept and Engineering Development of Cyber Physical Production Systems: A Systematic Literature Review"**  
*(Wu et al., 2020 | DOI: [10.1007/s00170-020-06110-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-020-06110-2))*

## **Objective/Purpose**  
To conduct a **systematic literature review (SLR)** analyzing the development of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) in Industry 4.0, focusing on:  
- Concept development (needs analysis, architecture exploration, definition).  
- Engineering development (5C architecture: Connection, Conversion, Cyber, Cognition, Configuration).  
- Identification of research gaps and a future agenda for CPPS integration in industrial practices.  

---

## **Key Methods**  
1. **SLR Framework**: Followed Brocke et al.’s 5-step methodology:  
   - Scope definition, keyword selection, database search (ISI Web of Science, 1,102 initial papers), screening (100 final articles), and synthesis.  
2. **Categorization**: Classified articles into **8 sub-categories** across two stages:  
   - **Concept Development**: Needs analysis (3 articles), concept exploration (17), concept definition (26).  
   - **Engineering Development**: 5C architecture levels (Connection: 21, Conversion: 5, Cyber: 20, Cognition: 6, Configuration: 2).  
3. **Analysis**: Mapped research topics to the CPPS lifecycle and proposed a concept map for future integration.

## **Main Findings**  

### **1. Concept Development Stage**  
- **Needs Analysis**: Limited focus on non-technical needs (e.g., environmental, economic).  
- **Concept Exploration**:  
  - Dominated by multi-layer architectures (e.g., RAMI 4.0, 5C) but lacked standardization.  
  - Human-centric and big data-driven designs emerged.  
- **Concept Definition**:  
  - Relied on existing paradigms: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Holonic Manufacturing Systems (HMS), Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA).  
  - Model-driven approaches (e.g., digital twins) and co-simulation tools were highlighted.  

### **2. Engineering Development Stage (5C Architecture)**  
| **Level**          | **Focus**                                                                 | **Key Technologies**                              |  
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|  
| **Connection**      | Physical-device integration, security, communication protocols (OPC UA). | IoT, RFID, blockchain for secure M2M communication.|  
| **Conversion**      | Data processing and analytics (e.g., predictive maintenance).            | Machine learning, big data frameworks.            |  
| **Cyber**           | Centralized information hub, digital twins, cybersecurity.               | Cloud computing, virtualization.                  |  
| **Cognition**       | Decision support, human-system interfaces.                               | 3D visualization, context-aware systems.          |  
| **Configuration**   | Self-optimization, resilience control.                                   | Autonomous Production Control (APC).              |  

### **3. Gaps Identified**  
- **Multidisciplinary Integration**: Fragmented research across domains (mechanical, software, industrial engineering).  
- **Organizational Integration**: Lack of focus on Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) integration for business process alignment.  
- **Industrial Maturity**: Most implementations are lab-scale; real-world adoption requires dynamic reconfigurability and standardization.  

---

## **Conclusions**  
1. CPPS research is **fragmented**, with limited attention to organizational and non-technical needs.  
2. **Integration of EIS** (informational, technological, organizational) is critical for industrial scalability.  
3. **Future priorities**:  
   - Standardized architectures (e.g., RAMI 4.0 extensions).  
   - Cybersecurity frameworks and AI-driven autonomy.  
   - Bidirectional digital twins for real-time feedback.  

---

## **Significance**  
- Provides a **roadmap** for CPPS development, emphasizing integration challenges.  
- Guides researchers and practitioners in addressing gaps in multidisciplinary collaboration, security, and industrial scalability.  
- Highlights the role of digital twins and AI in achieving self-adaptive CPPS.

**Example Contextual Summary**  
*For Industry 4.0 review papers:*  
“Wu et al. (2020) identify CPPS implementation barriers, including fragmented architectures and limited EIS integration. Their SLR underscores the need for standardized frameworks and bidirectional digital twins to bridge gaps between lab-scale prototypes and industrial applications.”
