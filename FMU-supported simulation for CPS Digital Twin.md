# Summary of "FMU-supported Simulation for CPS Digital Twin"

## Research Focus

The study explores the integration of **Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs)** into **Digital Twin (DT)** simulations to enhance flexibility and reusability in modeling Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPS). The primary objective is to demonstrate how modular FMUs, supported by a **semantic data model**, enable real-time simulation of specific system behaviors (e.g., energy consumption) while maintaining digital continuity across the production lifecycle.

## Methodology

- **Modular FMUs**: FMUs were developed as black-box modules using the **Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)** standard. Each FMU simulates a specific behavior (e.g., energy consumption, machine states) and communicates with the main Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model via standardized inputs/outputs.
    
- **Semantic Data Model**: An **ontology** (modeled in Automation Markup Language, AML) structures static and dynamic production data, enabling interoperability between simulation tools and real-time synchronization with physical systems.
    
- **Laboratory Validation**: The approach was tested in Politecnico di Milano’s **Industry 4.0 Laboratory (I40LAB)** using a mobile phone assembly line. FMUs were connected to PLCs via OPC UA to compute energy consumption based on machine states (Idle, Working, Fault, etc.).

## Key Findings

1. **FMU Flexibility**:
    
    - FMUs allow selective activation of specific behaviors (e.g., energy consumption) without altering the core simulation.
        
    - Modules are reusable across simulation environments due to FMI standardization (e.g., MATLAB Simulink).
        
2. **Semantic Model for Digital Continuity**:
    
    - The AML-based ontology integrates real-time field data (e.g., machine states, sensor inputs) with simulations, ensuring consistent data representation.
        
    - Supports interoperability between heterogeneous tools and reduces data retrieval effort for simulations.
        
3. **Energy Consumption Validation**:
    
    - FMUs accurately calculated energy usage by tracking machine states and time intervals.
        
    - Test scenarios included fault conditions (e.g., drilling errors), demonstrating robustness in real-time computation.

## Practical Implications

- **Industry 4.0 Integration**: Enables dynamic decision-making (e.g., predictive maintenance, production optimization) through real-time DT updates.
    
- **Scalability**: FMUs can be replicated across production line stations, reducing development time for complex systems.
    
- **Future Applications**: Extendable to real-time production planning, maintenance scheduling, and human-operator interaction analysis.
