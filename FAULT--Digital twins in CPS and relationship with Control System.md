# Digital Twins : 
A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system designed to reflect a physical object accurately. It spans the object's life cycle, is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help make decisions.
## Digital twins Example :
-   Smart Cities
-   Shipping and Logistics
-   Mining

# ABSTRACT
Upon transitioning to 4.0 industrial applications ,many conflicts has raised  between the manufacturer and the end user , specially with the increasing number of integrating the edge-cutting technology has become an important prerequisite for smart manufacturing which led to the rise of a new phenomenal as Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) integrated in every aspect the industrial society. Speaking of integration , in the last years ,an extensive attention for Digital Twins (DT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) has appeared which helped a lot of manufacturer for a better production and efficiency . How ever many feedback from enterprise level market says that DT and CPS are not identical in any form , many approaches has been adapted by researchers to conduct a study about CPPS and DT to review their contribution into the engineering world of smart manufacturing in general.  

# INTRODUCTION 
The rise of the industry 4.0 led to the transition of manufactures to smart-manufactures , with the new integration of IT into the enterprise level business , the concept of CPS (Cyber Physical System) has been introduced in the new industry which is mainly about merging the Physical and the Digital world together in a possible way in an efficient way that can help business enhance their capability in production by automating small procedures by inventing smart appliance, and by the time these new integration will lead to a low level fails that will arise to even bigger failure . researchers took hands on studying this concept to prevent further error by conducting a SLR (Systematic Literature Review ) for further analysis of the CPPS concept . for the life production concept a new methodology has appeared for enhancing new capability's of the control system mainly introduced for the purpose of monitoring practice for following how physical system produce failure when arise . DT where fundamentally a new concept on how smart-manufacture enhance their efficiency on production and collect information that will allow the industry explode in advanced engineering. 
This paper will cover a literal review the relationship between CPS and DT's in the modern industry and their capability to enhance Control System . This paper is organized as follows: [section 2](#origin-of-cps) give a general introduction about main components needed to understand the review , [section 3]() mapping the relationship between the Control System and CPS ,[section 4]() talks about the efficiency provided by the DTs paradigm and finally a conclusion drown in [section 5](#conclusion).

<h1 id="origin-of-cps">1. The origin of CPS :</h1>
The first appearance of the word Cyber-Physical-System was first in the National Science Foundation [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/) conference by [Dr. D. Helen Gill](https://dblp.org/pid/81/5770.html) to explain how system are evolving to be complex that describing it by the multiple words (Control System, Embedded system, Hybrid Systems) , too many components emerged together resulting to acquire a new name as Cyber-Physical Systems . As the name states ,CPS were the main concern between scientists in the US since it brought an immense improvement to the industry and helped the economics till its presence become fundamental in most manufactures which led to the born of smart-manufactures. In Germany , CPS is considered to be the core of the industrial society for its benefits that brought since its appearance which cause the shifting from [knowledge-based intelligence](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/978-3-642-74354-2_15) to [data-driven knowledge](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/coginf.2005.1532641) which is a combination of data provided by smart systems and the base knowledge of an individual that highlighted the use of data analytics and advanced information. CPS presented the integration of Computing , Communication and Control also known as 3C ,  CPS provide real-time sensing, information feedback, dynamic control, and other services . 

<h1 id="origin-of-cps">2. The birth of Digital Twins :</h1>
Another concept associated with CPS integration is Digital Twins . It presented by Michael Grieves in 2003  on Product Life-cycle Management (PLM) conference at the University of Michigan , the immaturity of technology were preventing for further studies on this new paradigm which lead to no new application studies by researchers at that time. DT was figured to be a simulation of the cyber system in a virtual world to recapitulate , monitor and supervise real world control machines and collect data that can be used to prevent any further error that may occur's during real time  production , this methodology also enhanced many business nowadays that almost every enterprise-level manufactures adopted this paradigm since it provided a lot of benefits to the industry . the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US Air Force adopted DTs in their health maintenance and for the remaining useful life prediction of aerospace vehicles , enhancing the life-cycle of the control system , and by the enhanced technologies in IT , DT are able to provide a huge amount of data that cannot be followed by traditional knowledge analysis but introducing the concept of Data-Driven Knowledge solved the issue and helped improving the paradigm of DT to a higher level . From another perspective DT is more likely to be used in the engineering field and CPS more of a scientific field. 
## 2.2 DT over the years : 
Many problem raised required advanced solutions, a form based concept has been evolved from the seek of newer problems that describe how to handle advanced architectures process that require a next-level monitoring procedures and supervision . Conducting a newer model for the DT architecture , engineers are able to provide a newer solution for this problem by dividing the control system into 3 layers , each has its own specification and number of CPS , that collaboratively collect data to the next layer as show in the figure below

### 2.2.1 Unit Level :
Unit level is also know the smallest member of equipment (e.g., a machine tool or robot arm) material (e.g., raw material or component with radio frequency identification (RFID) devices or sensors), or even environmental factor, constitute the physical part and its digital twin, at the unit level , many machines digitally help together to provide data for error correctness later , which will help for an efficient production and resilient machine through data exchange and data processing
### 2.2.2 System Level : 
At the unit level , many DTs and CPS achieve interconnection and interoperability, enabling a wider range of data flow. The integration of multiple CPS and DT will achieve optimal allocation of manufacturing resources, and improve the collaboration among various resources, DT must be formed through the integration and collaboration of multiple unit-level models. so a system-level is generally to be considered as a complex product,
