# Digital Twin and CPS 
**Some noting i took while preparing some research paper**   

# Digital Twins : 
A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system designed to reflect a physical object accurately. It spans the object's life cycle, is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help make decisions.
## Digital twins Example :
-   Smart Cities
-   Shipping and Logistics
-   Mining
# Key words 
Control System , Cyber Physical Productions System , Digital Twin , 3C , PLM

# Software 
Obsidian
